# React + Vite + JWT

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, some ESLint rules, and JWT authentication.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Additionally, JWT authentication can be integrated to secure your application. You can use libraries such as [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) for handling JWTs in your React application.
